<main><section id="intro"><h2>1. 概述</h2>

<p id="_1">CEO-LD项目的第二次会议于2016年2月28日在北京航空航天大学唯实酒店（Vision Hotel）举行。会议的前半部分，与会者聆听了来自不同应用领域应用场景的短报告，在下午的讨论中，重点讨论如何在这些场景中，哪些技术工作对于推进在对地观测领域使用互连数据技术（Linked data in EO）有帮助，并形成一系列具体的合作任务。</p>
<p>在上午的讨论中，项目的各个参与方也对中国移动、中国电子技术标准化研究院的技术专家的到来表示欢迎。</p>
</section>

<section id="CRSNet"><h2>2. CRSNet项目</h2>
<p>来自中科院遥感与数字地球所的李国庆研究员介绍了他的研究组在中国遥感网络（China Remote Sensing Network，CRSNet）项目的进展。该项目启动与2011年，并将于近期完成。在这个项目的重点并不是地理覆盖数据的共享，但该项目所面对的挑战与CEO-LD项目要解决的问题非常相关。</p>
<p>该项目分为两个阶段：建设资源，并建立集成平台；通过使用各类传感数据在全球范围内解决问题。该项目提供了超过 40种“公共服务（Common Products）”来提供应用服务，覆盖辐射监测（radiation budgets）, 农作物监测（vegetation structures）, 全球冰川变化（global ice change），这些应用使用了分布在不同时间和空间尺度上的观测数据。李国庆认为，当处理类似这些应用所需的多维数据时，因为数据量大、处理逻辑复杂，我们不能完全依靠在线处理（online-processing），很多处理需要离线进行（offline），并将离线处理的结果作为一类“产品”提供给Web应用，支持跨越多维数据的分析。</p>
<p>对于这些数据产品来说，仅支持地理空间和时间维度并不足够，还需要支持其他领域相关的覆盖数据类型，如波段（wavebands），，及其底层的语义。这是互联数据（Linked Data）相关工作擅长的，能够帮助更多数据集细节信息的不同领域专家参与进来。</p>
<p>在创建某个预先确定的通用产品（pre-determined Common Products）时，可能需要3个层次的粒度（精度，如10m, 100m 及 1km）。如果应用需要30m的数据精度（granularity），就需要将数据归一化到10m。在时间维度上，数据集提供每天两次的更新，但基于数据构造的工具可能需要每8天更新以此，这样，数据代理（broker）需要处理这种可能的错误。同时，还需要注意到，尽管本项目关注卫星对地观测数据，CRSNet不仅使用基于卫星的观测数据，还使用了机载的遥感数据，而后者可能使数据的处理更加复杂。</p>
<p>基于这些考虑，在CRSNet中使用了复杂的工作流机制，CEO－LD项目可以通过帮助Web应用更好的使用数据，来使非专家用户更容易理解和应用基于卫星及航空平台的遥感及对地观测数据。</p>
<p>李国庆报告后的讨论，也涉及到这些中国对地观测项目数据（或世界上其他机构投资的类似项目数据）能否公开获得的讨论。CRSNet的数据可以提供给中国研究机构开展各类相关研究，但是否能够支持商业应用仍有待进一步讨论（is not sufficiently liberal for operational uses）。</p>

<section id="dataCloud"><h2>3. 地理数据云（Geospatial Data Cloud）</h2>
<p>Xuezhi Wang presented the work being done by the Chinese Network Information Centre of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CNIC) to provide a one stop shop for spatial data services: <a href="http://giscloud.cn">GIS Cloud</a>. The service is based on the USGS data which was opened for public use in 2008 and includes more than 350TB of data entities with more than 7 million records covering China from LANDSAT, MODIS etc. The traditional way of working would be to download data and process it locally using ArcGIS. In contrast, CNIC's service allows users to submit tasks that the platform performs (on virtual machines) after which the processed data can be downloaded and/or visualised.</p>
<p>GIS Cloud is a powerful tool that allows users to search by address, geolocation or administrative unit, and render multiple wavebands as raster layers with false colours, combine data across layers and edit vectors on the Web page. The visualisation tools in the platform use an HTML5-based map client with dynamic cache, map style editing etc. But all the processing is done server side. CNIC is interested in ways to move at least some of the processing to the browser to reduce latency.</p>
<p>The meeting agreed that this case provides further evidence for the need for the kind of approach being looked at by CEO-LD. It emphasised the need to be able to identify and use subsets of data and that any data needs to carry its contextual information. In the case of GIS Cloud, the platform provides all the context implicitly, but if the data itself is to be manipulated client side then the context needs to be explicit.</p>
<p>It was noted that USGS's opening of their data led directly to many new international relations and partnerships. The first use of any data is by its producer, but it's the second and third users who add value to that data by their reuse. CNIC's metadata service is based on OGC's <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/cat">CSW standard</a>.</p>

<section id="taxi"><h2>4. 车联网数据应用（Taxi!）</h2>
<p>Beihang University's Tianyu Wo talked about his work with 'U-Car' chauffeured car services. At first sight this topic seems to be at a tangent to that of coverages, however, location-based data such as customer waiting times and fuel consumption along a particular route is important, and the amount of data being handled is substantial. The data platform for U-Car currently receives 120 million messages per day (each vehicle sends an update on its position and OBD every 10 seconds) and the company is growing rapidly. The total amount of data is too large to be handled in the browser and so needs some server side pre-processing, but manipulating processed data in the browser has great potential. The need is to be able to handle multiple data sources in real time and it's notable that the cars go in and out of coverage (in tunnels etc.). A potentially useful design feature of HTML5 therefore is its ability to cope with intermittent connectivity. Non-spatial data, such as events that are likely to generate demand for taxis, or poor weather and other factors that one can predict might increase demand in a given location are all potentially useful.</p>

<section id="melodies"><h2>5. MELODIES项目</h2>
<p>Maik Riechert of the University of Reading gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxfmTkBdn90">demonstration</a> of his work in the <a href="http://melodiesproject.eu/">MELODIES project</a> which has advanced significantly since the initial CEO-LD meeting. As noted by Tianyu Wo, there will always be some things that need to be done server side, but by moving some of the data to the browser, it's possible to make it more available for use in a diversity of Web applications that may be created by those with no specialist knowledge of geospatial and satellite data. To an outsider, the MELODIES demo looks like images but it's data that's sent to the browser and laid on top of a base image. A 3000 x 2000 pixel coverage is readily handled in the browser but care is needed. JSON can be compressed before being sent to the browser but when uncompressed can easily become too large to handle.</p>

<p>Having data available in the browser provides more flexibility than may be available in server side processing. As an example, the UK's Department of the Environment and Rural Affairs' remit doesn't extend to the sea so they only ever want to look at satellite data related to the land. Maik showed how he was able to strip out the sea areas of a land cover dataset and create and manipulate a smaller dataset, all in the browser using a regular Web developer's toolkit as, to emphasise the point, his application is handling data, not images.</p>

<p>The Chinese colleagues could see the advantages and potential of the MELODIES approach and there followed a discussion about the maximum size of a dataset that is sensible to send to a browser. Not long ago, 40MB would be too much, now it is probably OK. Perhaps content negotiation can be used to return an amount of data within a defined maximum as either a set of pages connected by HTTP Link Headers, or perhaps a more complex option would be to return the data in different resolutions depending on the HTTP accept headers received. A further alternative might be to only send, say, 10MB tiles at a time and allow the browser to 'say when' it's had as much as it can cope with. Maik showed how his application only requests a certain amount of data at a time when a user clicks on a control for selecting a time step and, as the data packages are small, the latency is well within acceptable limits. Importantly, the data held is discarded from memory before the next set is loaded so that the application doesn't become more bloated as it is used. As for other web resources, the browser cache is used implicitly when loading data that had been loaded before but which had been discarded from memory in the meantime.</p>

<section id="collaboration"><h2>6. 中英合作（UK-China Collaboration）</h2>
<p>The participants spent some time thinking about how to realise a solid collaboration. OGC's Denise McKenzie suggested that we focus on specific themes that are important in both countries, such as agriculture, disaster management, water, or fire management. It was also clear that those in the room were mostly concerned with data management, rather than being end users. Geoffrey Boulton remarked that in his work on ice caps, he has to handle images; he'd much rather have Maik working with him to turn it into data that he can manipulate.</p>
<p>Jianhui Li pointed out that CNIC provides services to scientists, i.e. specialists in specific fields, not generalist Web application developers. Guoqing Li suggested working on a new Common Product, perhaps a national vegetation index, but that the idea of exposing data that can be used in a Web application, rather than providing a complete service based on back end processing, would mean a new workflow. There was much discussion about where the participants could see the approach being useful in a future project, tied to an ongoing programme and how the collaboration would work in practice.</p>
<p>The discussion for the remainder of the day continued to be wide ranging with many 'future possibilities' but everyone was cognisant of the limited time available in the current project and keen to deliver a practical outcome that can be the basis of future work. After a good deal of discussion, it was agreed that:</p><dl>
<dt>RADI<dt><dd> will develop two new Common Products, a Normalised Difference Vegetation Index and a Leaf Area Index that would be made available via a RESTful API with a WGS84 coordinate reference system. The Common products would be available as HDF5 and GeoTIFF.</dd>

<dt>CNIC</dt><dd>will write a library that converts HDF5 and GeoTIFF to the <a href="https://github.com/Reading-eScience-Centre/coveragejson/blob/master/spec.md">CoverageJSON</a> format under development at the University of Reading and expose that data through an API. The data will be 'just too big' for a browser to handle in full and therefore will need to offer a mechanism for delivery of subsets of the data. The service will be hosted on CNIC's Geospatial Data Cloud infrastructure.</dd>

<dt>University of Reading</dt><dd>will support CNIC in the development of their service, amending and updating the CoverageJSON spec in the light of the experiences gained. Reading will also develop a client application to support grid comparison.</dd>
<dt>Beihang University</dt><dd>will investigate an independent application that makes use of the RADI and CNIC APIs.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The outcome of the work will be demonstrated during the <strong>OGC</strong>'s Technical Committee meeting in Dublin on 22 June at 09:00 local time, 15:00 Beijing. OGC will manage the invitation and registration process for that occasion.</p>
<p><strong>W3C</strong> will report on the project and continue to ensure good communication between the CEO-LD project and the OGC/W3C Spatial Data on the Web Working Group. It is notable in that regard that since the Beijing meeting, Bill Roberts of SWIRRL has convened a separate meeting series of SDW WG members interested in the coverages work (he, Maik Riechert and Jitao Yang of RADI are the editors of the Coverages in Linked Data specification).  In parallel with the CEO-LD project, a team at the Australian National University in Canberra will also experiment with CoverageJSON and look at alternatives, thus providing an independent view.</p>
<p>In this way, the SDW WG will have empirical evidence on which to base the development of the standard that goes substantially beyond what is normally available. This is important since it is clear that the concepts of turning satellite images into data that can be manipulated by Web developers with little or no knowledge of Earth Observation technologies and methods are new. The collaboration with colleague in the UK and China ensures that the methods are cross border and cross cultural with active discussions about future collaborations of mutual interest and benefit.</p>
