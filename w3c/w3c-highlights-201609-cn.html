        <h2 id="intro">1. 概述</h2>
        <p>在过去的几个月里，W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/03/w3c-highlights/Overview.html">重点开展了</a>
          Web 安全的工作，并关注一系列与 Web相关的垂直行业领域的合作。其中最值得关注的工作包括：</p>
        <ul>
          <li>数字出版: 让 “Web = 出版（Publishing）” 距离现实越来越近。</li>
          <li>HTML：探索HTML的定期发布机制，寻找HTML的前沿和新特性。</li>
          <li>有粘性的Web Platform：W3C中一系列引起产业界关注的技术——支付、物联万维网（WoT）、Web实时通讯（WebRTC），以及核心Web平台中的关键技术。</li>
        </ul>
        <p>此外，W3C在内部组织架构调整上，也迈出重要一步，W3C的组织架构正在经历一次 <a href="org">重组（reorganization）</a>，以期更好的面对今天快速发展的Web，及其丰富的用户、开发者和实现者的期望。
         </p>
        <h2 id="digpub">2.数字出版</h2>
        <p>W3C继续加强Web技术与相关工业领域的结合。数字出版是最先被识别的而交叉领域之一，在这一领域中，Web技术正在积极拥抱出版行业的变革，通过Web技术提供跨设备的集成体验。</p>
        <p>Web支持了几乎所有的民生需求（civilization needs），并通过新技术的发展，不断满足新的需求。数字出版是W3C这几年重点关注的新需求方向之一。</p>
        <p>
数字出版与其他Web内容的边界正在变得模糊，为数字出版创造富媒体环境的努力正在为读者、作者和出版商提供新的可能性。为了协调出版行业与核心Web技术的发展，W3C与<abbr title="International Digital Publishing Forum">IDPF</abbr>在多年合作之后，正式<a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/05/digpub.html.en">宣布了合并计划</a> ，通过合并后的紧密合作，更有效的在开放Web平台上支持先进出版技术的研发探索。</p>
        <p>为了更好的支持Web出版，IDPF 和 W3C
          在过去三年时间已经开展广泛的合作，并构建数字出版的生态系统，在EPUB3中，IDPF采用HTML5及CSS来支持电子内容的排版，目前，包括SVG、MathML等在内的更多W3C组件纳入到EPub中。
        此外，IDPF与W3C正在定义未来数字出版的新形态—— <abbr title="Portable Web Publications">便携式Web出版物（PWP，Portable Web Publications）</abbr>。我们期待这能够带来对EPUB 3的新一轮革命。数字出版兴趣组（Digital Publishing Interest Group）已经发布了关于 <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/pwp-ucr/">便携式Web出版物用例与需求（Portable
            Web Publications Use Cases and Requirements）</a> 的首份工作草案，这是后续EPUB和PWP的基础。IDPF的前期工作已经在推动CSS的进步，W3C在Web无障碍方面的工作也有助于我们设计无障碍的电子出版物（accessibile electronic publications）。W3C
          将帮助EPUB和便携式Web出版物在图书出版行业以外更加有影响力，
          同时，IDPF在图书出版行业中的影响力也将使 W3C的PWP工作能够得到来自出版行业的更多
          支持。随着更多Web技术社区的参与，我们希望 基于Web的便携式文档标准能够成为 EPUB3  
         的演进，并得到更加广泛的关注和采用。</p>

        <h2 id="htmlcss">3.应用开发</h2>
        <p>我们正在探索HTML的定期发布机制，寻找HTML的前沿和新特性。HTML5的演进从没停止。W3C在2014年10月发布了HTML 5.0的推荐标准，我们预计在2016年秋发布 HTML 5.1的推荐标准，。与此同时，HTML 5.2 的开发工作也已经启动，这使得 HTML的定期、持续、增量更新成为可能。</p>
        <p>W3C在2016年9月已经发布了 <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2016JulSep/0086.html">HTML&nbsp;5.1的提案推荐标准</a>。这一版本的<a href="http://w3c.github.io/html/changes.html#changes">主要变化</a>
          在文档中提及，在HTML5的基础上，提升稳定性，可读性和可理解性，并更易于被Web技术社区理解和采用。</p>
        <p>同时，Web平台工作组（Web Platform Working Group）发布了<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/">HTML&nbsp;5.2</a>的首份公开标准工作草案。
          其中的一些新特性因尚未确认互操作性，而未能加入到 HTML 5.1的最终推荐标准文本中。此外，HTML 5.2还修改了一些文字缺陷。这一工作是 HTML 5.2 进入W3C推荐标准流程的起点，我们希望在2017年底前后，能够将 HTML 5.2 推进到W3C推荐标准。</p>
	<p>对于未来HTML的新特性，我们将首先在“孵化组（incubator）”中研发和讨论，当这些新特性得到了多种浏览器内核、编辑工具、内容生产工具及用户的实现验证支持后，我们才会将其纳入到工作组，并作为新特性写入下一版本的HTML标准。已经设立的 <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/">Web平台孵化社区组（WICG，Web Platform Incubator Community Group）</a> 将帮助这些未来新特性的孵化与讨论。</p>
        <p>Web平台工作组（Web Platform Working Group）正在确认如何将一项较为成熟的新特性从孵化组转移到工作组。目前在孵化组讨论的一些热点特性包括：支付支持、目录上传（directory upload）、视口API（viewport API）、后台同步（background sync）。此外，还有一些工作正在由 CSS 和<abbr title="Technical Architecture Group">W3C技术架构组（TAG）</abbr>联合任务组的<a href="https://github.com/w3c/css-houdini-drafts/wiki">CSS
            Houdini</a> 项目中加以推动。</p>
        <p>您可以通过 <a href="https://github.com/w3c/html/pulse/monthly">Github
            pulse</a>追踪这些标准工作的进展，或在 Twitter 上关注 <a href="https://twitter.com/html_commits">@HTML_commits</a>

        <h2 id="cohesion">4.有粘性的Web平台</h2>
        <p>在继续开发 HTML之外，W3C还在关注其他能够扩展Web平台的方向：Web支付，物联万维网（Web of Things）, Web实时通讯（WebRTC）以及Web安全。所有这些新方向都有助于加强Web平台的粘性，。最近，W3C开始探索区块链（Blockchain）技术与Web的结合点。W3C在2016年6月29-30日举办了关于 (<a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/04/blockchain-workshop/">区块链与Web——W3C分布式账本技术研讨会（Blockchains
            and the Web, a W3C Workshop on Distributed Ledgers on the Web）</a>，详情请见该研讨会的 <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/04/blockchain-workshop/report.html">总结报告</a>，识别了一系列可能的标准化研究方向，包括但不局限于多种身份识别与存在性证明方法（proof-of-existence），可增强分布式账本间互操作性的小型区块链原语（primitives）等。</p>
        <p>在今年3月举行的W3C顾问委员会（AC Meeting）上，开启了关于什么是<a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/Talks/ac2016-Jeff/public.html">未来Web的重要方向（next big thing for the Web）</a> 的讨论 A straw poll yielded:与投票，得票较多的一些共识方向如下：</p>

        <p>The publishing community is an important community to engage in W3C.
          Digital publishing is increasingly impacted by the Web. Publishers
          need to understand how the technology of the Web is evolving. The Web
          can benefit from the centuries of expertise in the publishing industry
          on typography and layout, improving the core Web technologies not only
          for electronic publications but for all Web content.</p>
        <p>Currently one W3C group is dedicated to understanding and documenting
          the particular needs of the publishing community: the <a href="http://www.w3.org/dpub/IG">Digital
            Publishing Interest Group</a>.</p>
        <p>The Interest Group aims at continuing the work on and around <abbr title="Portable Web Publications">PWP</abbr>,
          CSS related issues, as well as Accessibility. Reinforcing the ties
          with the publishing community at large, in particular with
          implementers, tool developers, but also with the scholarly publishing
          community, remains high on the agenda, as well as outreach activities
          around the relationships between publishing and the development of Web
          Technologies.</p>

                which is giving the overall framework most of the Interest
                Group’s work. The current work concentrates on a <strong>comprehensive

                Interest Group is also busy in the area of <strong>Accessibility,
                  working with the ARIA Working Group</strong> (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-aria-1.0/">Digital
                  Publishing WAI-ARIA Module 1.0</a>); finally, it has a <strong>strong

        <p>The International Digital Publishing Forum (<a href="http://idpf.org">IDPF</a>)
          is a global standards organization dedicated to the development and
          promotion of electronic publishing and digital content consumption.
          IDPF members include publishers, technology firms, other industry
          associations, and government and educational organizations. IDPF is
          the developer of the EPUB standard format for interchange and
          distribution of digital publications.</p>
        <p>As <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-ac-members/2016AprJun/0009.html">announced
            to Members</a> and subsequently in <a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/5399">home
            page news</a> and a <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/05/digpub.html.en">press
            release</a> the IDPF leadership and W3C leadership are studying the
          possibility of merging the work of IDPF into W3C. There is near-total
          synergy between the technical work of the two organizations. IDPF's
          work is fully dependent on core Open Web Platform technologies; the
          EPUB&nbsp;3 standard is based on HTML, CSS, SVG, and MathML. W3C's Web
          Accessibility work is fundamental to the design of accessible
          electronic publications. Technical contributions from the publishing
          community are helping to improve the capabilities of CSS. Publication
          packaging technology specified especially for EPUB ought to be based
          on new OWP technologies in scope for the Web Platform Working Group.</p>

        <p>Web Annotation is a type of <abbr title="user-generated content">UGC</abbr>
          content that refers and links to other Web content (<strong>deep
            linking</strong>). This may be a comment on an article, a set of
          captions on an image or video, a footnote in an eBook, a citation in a
          scholarly paper, an editorial highlight in a copy-edit workflow, or
          many other types of referential content. Often, web annotations are
          published and shared elsewhere than the original content, and may be
          shared on social media, like Twitter or Facebook, with a link back to
          the original content.</p>

        <p>The W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/2014/automotive/">Automotive
            Working Group</a>, based on conversations with other groups at TPAC,
          took a step back and looked at the <strong>architecture</strong> for
          its API and accompanying data spec. </p>
        <ul>
          <li> Ongoing work:
            <ul>
              <li> The previous Working Draft was a WebIDL approach that would
                require someone to write a browser extension to make a native
                Vehicle object available to developers and the accompanying data
                spec was an attempt at trying to define a common core set of
                signal data that most auto manufacturers could provide. After
                deliberation, exploring and dismissing Sensor API approach, we
                considered a <strong>RESTful API and Web Sockets service
                  approach</strong>. Some of the benefits, in brief, are <strong>not
                  needing to maintain browser extensions in step with security
                  upgrades, ability to be more granular in access control for a
                  service as security is a major concern and that the API can be
                  used in the vehicle by other platforms other than a web
                  runtime</strong>. </li>
              <li> This RESTful API can be used by QT In-Vehicle-Infotainment
                systems and headless applications. The architecture debate
                concluded at the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/04/28-auto-minutes.html#item02">April
                  F2F</a>. There is industry interest in this new approach. <strong>We
                  have also started collaborating on a more ambitious and
                  extensive data spec that can accommodate the differences in
                  data auto manufacturers provide</strong>. </li>
              <li> The group's charter was extended and will be rechartered when
                we have a better sense of timeline and deliverables. It has made
                tremendous progress on a new API and data specs. </li>

          of Community Groups and Working Groups including the HTML Media
          Extensions Working Group, the Second Screen Working Group, the TV
          Control Working Group, and a few other community groups and task
          forces. On top of the activities mentioned below, note that the group
          has discussed at TPAC 2015 the <strong>possibility to define a Web

        <h4 id="vr2">Virtual Reality</h4>
        <p>A number of industry players have announced important investments or
          initial products in Virtual Reality. What are the new features and
          improvements needed to make the Web a compelling platform for actual
          VR development?</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webvr/">WebVR Community
            Group</a> was created in March 2016 to incubate a <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webvr/">WebVR
            API specification</a>, under the impulse of Mozilla.</p>
        <p>W3C is organizing a <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/06/vr-workshop/">Web
            &amp; Virtual Reality workshop</a> on 19-20 October 2016 on the West
          Coast to look at the intersection of Web and Virtual Reality
          technologies. Topics of interest include: displaying stereoscopic
          content, detecting &amp; adapting to characteristics of VR headsets,
          handling new input methods for VR (gamepad, hand position, …), 3D
          audio, 3D media synchronization, interoperable formats and codecs for
          3D and 360 content, bringing VR as progressive enhancement to classic
          Web browsing, etc.</p>
        <h4 id="html-media">HTML Media</h4>
        <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/tr-groups-all#tr_HTML_Media_Extensions_Working_Group">All
            Documents: HTML Media Extensions Working Group</a></p>
        <p>The industry and the Consortium choice is to enhance HTML to be
          capable of playing video content without the help of plug-in video
          players, streaming technologies over HTTP such as Dynamic Adaptive
          Streaming over HTTP (DASH) has rapidly emerged in the industry. W3C
          took to develop two HTML5 extensions to enable UAs to play such
          streams.</p>
        <p>These extensions are essential to meet the industry requirements for
          video content delivery on the Web, by providing Web apps with more
          flexible control over video content, which enable advanced services
          such as dynamic ad-insertion.</p>
        <p>HTML Media, core media features of Web platform, is developed in the
          HTML Media Extensions Working Group. It is working on providing
          control over playback of encrypted content.</p>
        <p>Ongoing work:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> The <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/">HTML Media Extensions
              Working Group</a> is currently working on two extensions: Media
            Source Extensions (MSE) and Encrypted Media Extensions (EME).
            <ul>
              <li> MSE is a Candidate Recommendation that allows JavaScript to <strong>send
                  byte streams to media codecs within Web browsers that support
                  HTML5 video</strong>. It facilitates a variety of use cases
                like adaptive streaming and time shifting live streams (<a href="https://github.com/w3c/media-source">MSE
                  Github page</a>). </li>
              <li> EME is a Candidate Recommendation for providing a <strong>communication
                  channel between Web browsers and content protection systems to
                  allow playback of encrypted audio and video on the Web</strong>.
                This allows the use of HTML5 video to play back DRM-wrapped
                content such as streaming video services without the need for
                third-party media plugins like Adobe Flash or Microsoft
                Silverlight. (<a href="https://github.com/w3c/encrypted-media/">EME
                  on Github</a>) </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li> version 1.0 of the two extensions are planned to become W3C
            Recommendations on September 29th, as specified by the <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-media/2016May/0029.html">Group
              timeline</a>. </li>
          <li> There are some industry requests for additional features and

            an important milestone for the future work. </li>

        <p>Web content is available on an ever expanding array of devices
          including eBook readers, phones, tablets, laptops, auto displays, and
          electronic billboards, and there are a variety of mechanisms that
          allow these devices to use secondary display screens available in the
          local environment, attached by wired connections or remotely with
          wireless, peer-to-peer media. However, in most cases, lower layers
          such as OS provide those connection mechanisms, which Web apps,

              <li> Multi-device timing is important for the broadcasting
                industry, as well as for digital signage, and audio use cases. </li>
              <li> Such a mechanism could also <strong>improve the
                  accessibility of media content on the Web</strong>. For
                example, third party can easily provide additional audio track,
                such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/media-accessibility-reqs/#clean-audio">Clean

        <p>Progress are being made to ensuring that HTML is truly part of the
          extensible Web, to enable feature development and iteration through
          the use of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
        <h4 id="html51">Track for HTML&nbsp;5.1 REC</h4>
        <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/WebPlatform/WG/">Web Platform Working
            Group</a> is on track to deliver a <strong>Recommendation for
            HTML&nbsp;5.1</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/w3c/html">HTML on GitHub</a>) 
	  this year, with a working approach that will make it
          possible to deliver a further improved HTML Recommendation
          (HTML&nbsp;5.2) in another year. The Group closed more issues than it
          opened, and now has a working rhythm for the specification that is
          getting up to the speed it wants. There are a few features marked “at
          risk”, which means they will be removed from HTML5.1 if the Group find
          during the Candidate Recommendation that they do not work in at least
          two shipping browsers. The Web Platform WG hopes that HTML5.1 is
          better than HTML5, and that it would benefit the web community if we
          updated the “gold standard”. The work on HTML&nbsp;5.2 already started
          and includes features such as module scripts.</p>
        <h4 id="webapps">Extensible Web &amp; (real) Web Applications</h4>
        <p>The work on Web components (Custom Elements, Shadow DOM) is
          progressing and getting broader deployment in implementations. This
          brings us closer to a reality when <strong>developers will be able to
            provide their own custom HTML elements, as components</strong>.</p>
        <p>We are also ensuring that Web applications are able to be behave like
          real applications and be more reliable. The Core of this work happens
          around the Service Workers effort, to <strong>enable offline support,
            application lifecycles (such as install, update), and background
            tasks (offline notification)</strong>. This allows the application
          to install properly and ensure from the start that the needed
          resources are available offline. <strong>The first version of Service
            Workers is expected to reach Candidate Recommendation in late
            September</strong>.</p>
        <h4 id="app-dev-other">Other ongoing work</h4>
        <p>The Web Platform Working Group is also producing several
          specifications (<a href="https://www.w3.org/WebPlatform/WG/PubStatus">Status</a>) 
	  that enable improved client-side application development on
          the Web, including application programming interfaces (APIs) for
          client-side development and markup vocabularies for describing and
          controlling client-side application behavior.</p>
        <ul>
          <li> ARIA in HTML defines the web developer rules (author conformance
            requirements) for the use of ARIA attributes on HTML elements. The
            first version will support ARIA&nbsp;1.1 and HTML&nbsp;5.1,
            following the same timeline as ARIA&nbsp;1.1. </li>
          <li> Web App Manifest defines a JSON-based manifest file that provides
            developers with a centralized place to put metadata associated with
            a web application. This metadata includes, but is not limited to,
            the web application's name, links to icons, as well as the preferred
            URL to open when a user launches the web application. </li>
          <li> Web IDL defines an interface definition language that can be used
            to describe interfaces that are intended to be implemented in web

        <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/members">CSS Working Group</a>
          is continuing its refinement and progress of the CSS language. The

            Documents: Timed Text Working Group</a></p>
        <p>Since the late 90s, the Consortium identified the need for proper
          online media captioning. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/TT/">Timed
            Text Working Group</a> is developing and maintaining formats used
          for the <strong>representation of text synchronized with other timed
            media, like audio and video</strong>. This work, begun in WAI,
          enables online captioning, which is critically important to ensure
          accessibility of TV and video on the web for people who are deaf and
          hard of hearing. In recent years with the convergence of traditional
          media and the Web, more video content from television is coming to the
          Web, and the Web is now running on televisions. TTML helps to bridge
          these worlds.</p>
        <p>Ongoing work:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> The Timed Text Markup Language (TTML) 2 specification (<a href="https://github.com/w3c/ttml2/">TTML2
              on GitHub</a>) defines a timed text media format for the purpose
            of interchange among authoring systems. It is intended to be used
            for the purpose of transcoding or exchanging timed text information
            among legacy distribution content formats presently in use for
            subtitling and captioning functions. In January 2016, W3C received
            an Emmy® Award for Standards Work on Accessible Video Captioning and
            Subtitles for its work on the TTML 1.0 W3C Recommendation; read the
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/01/emmyawardttml.html.en">press
              release</a>. </li>
          <li> the Web Video Text Tracks format (WebVTT) (<a href="https://github.com/w3c/webvtt">WebVTT
              on GitHub</a>) provide captions or subtitles for video content,
            and also text video descriptions [MAUR], chapters for content
            navigation, and more generally any form of metadata that is
            time-aligned with audio or video content. Its main use is for
            marking up external text track resources in connection with the HTML
            &lt;track&gt; element. </li>
          <li> The TTML Profiles for Internet Media Subtitles and Captions
            (IMSC) specifications define two profiles of TTML: a text-only
            profile and an image-only profile. These profiles are intended to be
            used across subtitle and caption delivery applications worldwide,
            thereby simplifying interoperability, consistent rendering and
            conversion to other subtitling and captioning formats. IMSC1 became
            a recommendation in May 2016; read the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/05/pressrelease-imsc1-recommendation.html.en">press

              on GitHub</a>). </li>
          <li> The Group also published the TTML Media Type Definition and
            Profile Registry, which defines the application/xml+ttml media type

        <p>Everyone would agree that it's better to have a Web that is fast
          rather than slow. In the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2010/webperf/">Web

          improve aspects of application performance of user agent features and

            Timing specification by September 2016</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/w3c/resource-hints/">Resource
            Timing on GitHub)</a>. It captures the end to end latency associated
          with loading resources from a web server.</p>
        <p>Work has also been ongoing on defining primitives that enable the
          developer, and the server generating or delivering the resources, to
          assist the user agent in the decision process of which origins it
          should connect to, and which resources it should fetch and pre-process
          to improve page performance (<a href="https://w3c.github.io/resource-hints/">Resource

        <h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>
        <p>Perhaps the biggest news about our Testing effort is that there is a
          plan to soon <strong>merge the CSS test suite</strong> into our core
          Web Platform Tests test suite.</p>
        <p>With that merge, here are some current data points about the Web
          Platform Tests test suite:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> contains tests for more than <strong>130 specs</strong> (more
            than 80 API specs and more than 50 CSS specs) </li>
          <li> contains more than <strong>18,000 test cases</strong> (more than
            7000 API test cases, and more than 11,000 CSS test cases) </li>
          <li> produces more than <strong>300,000 test results</strong> in
            total for each browser engine it is run against </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that we have in practice basically <strong>retired the Test the
            Web Forward brand</strong> that had been associated with our testing
          effort in the past and helped get some momentum going behind it in
          earlier years. While the <a href="http://testthewebforward.org/">testthewebforward.org/</a>
          website continues to exist for now, it may eventually be mothballed
          (which would amount in the near term to having it just become a
          redirect either to <a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/tree/master/docs">web-platform-tests</a>
          or to a new URL under just the Web Platform Tests brand).</p>
        <h4>General background on the Web Platform Tests test suite</h4>
        <p>Our testing effort centers on creating a set of test cases, <a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/">Web
            Platform Tests</a>, with coverage for every standard feature of the
          Web runtime, for these purposes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> to ensure interoperability of the Web runtime among <a href="https://gist.github.com/mathiasbynens/9e26f733b53dd6a9d417">all
              four major browser engines</a> currently in use: Apple’s WebKit,
            Google’s Blink, Microsoft’s EdgeHTML, and Mozilla’s Gecko; </li>
          <li> to facilitate new browser-engine projects (such as <a href="https://servo.org/">Mozilla
              Servo</a>) in development and testing of their engines and
            interoperability with currently-used engines. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Interoperability</strong> of standard features of the Web
          runtime across all browser engines ensures that Web developers can
          create Web content using those standard features without needing to
          write multiple code paths or hacks to work around browser differences.</p>
        <p>The features tested by the Web Platform Tests test suite include both
          standard Web runtime APIs that are available to Web developers to use
          in their JavaScript code to control behavior of their Web
          applications, as well as CSS features that Web developers can use in
          their CSS stylesheets to control the presentational look-and-feel of
          their Web applications and Web documents [once the CSS test suite has
          actually been merged into the Web Platform Tests test suite, which
          should happen later this summer].</p>
        <h2 id="privacy-security">Privacy and Security</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/#tr_Security_for_Web_Applications">All
            Standards and Drafts: Security for Web Applications</a></p>
        <p>The fundamental line of trust on the Web is between the end-user and
          the Web application: individuals who visit a website rely on HTTPS to
          trust that they are getting the page or application put there by the
          site owner. Features of Web Application Security are designed to
          support that trust, protecting against cross-site scripting and
          content-injection attacks or unwanted snooping on Web traffic. If a
          Web application includes resources from third parties, however, it may
          effectively delegate its trust to all of those included resources, any
          of which could maliciously or carelessly compromise the overall
          security of the Web application and data shared with it.</p>
        <ul>
          <li> <a href="https://www.w3.org/webauthn/">Web Authentication

              <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/">WebAuthn API</a></strong>,
            bringing strong cryptographic authentication to the Web platform (to
            reduce the reliance on password-based authentication). </li>
          <li> <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/webappsec/">WebAppSec WG</a>
            continued its work to improve the security available to web
            application developers and users and easing the <strong>HTTPS
              transition</strong>. The WG published a <strong>Recommendation of
              <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SRI/">Subresource Integrity</a></strong>,
            and Candidate Recommendations of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/CR-CSP2-20150721/">CSP

        </ul>
        <p>Subresource Integrity (SRI), which just reached W3C Recommendation
          status, offers a way to include resources without that open-ended
          delegation. It lets browsers, as user-agents, cryptographically verify
          that the integrity of included subresources such as scripts and
          styles, matches as-delivered what was expected by the requesting
          application.</p>
        <h3 id="wot2">Web of Things</h3>
        <p>There are huge business and societal opportunities for the Internet
          of Things (IoT), but this is being held back by fragmentation with a
          confusing set of non-interoperable platforms, standards and
          technologies. Without care any new standards would just add to the
          fragmentation.</p>
        <p>The key to overcoming the fragmentation of the IoT and catalyzing
          exponential growth in services will be <strong>enabling end to end
            interoperability across different platforms</strong>. This requires
          open standards for metadata that defines the data and interaction
          models exposed to applications, the protocols and communication
          patterns that can be used, the security and privacy policies, and
          descriptions of the kinds of things that are involved and the
          relationships between them. In short, to enable a Web of Things, and
          to expand the Web from a web of pages to a web of things.</p>
        <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/">Web of Things Interest Group</a>
          is preparing the way with work on use cases, and requirements,
          technology landscape studies, and emphasis on implementation
          experience.</p>
        <p>Things have URIs for their names, which can be de-referenced to
          access metadata describing a thing. The formal basis for this metadata
          is W3C's resource description framework (RDF), but the syntax can vary
          according to the context, e.g. JSON, XML, and other formats. By
          analogy with the cross platform API for Internet sockets, we see a <strong>need
            for a cross platform API for things</strong>. This builds upon the
          success of event driven programming by treating things in terms of
          their properties, actions and events.</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Ongoing work:
            <ul>
              <li> We’re looking for help with defining standard vocabularies,
                APIs and protocol bindings, security, privacy and resilience,
                along with enablers for dynamic open markets of services
                including discovery, automated negotiation of prices, terms and

              <li> How to foster convergence on a common set of models for
                things, e.g. in smart homes. Proposals for these could be a big
                help with this goal. </li>
              <li> A related challenge is how to support an agile process for
                standardizing models, with a clear progression for increasing
                maturity from experimental, to commercially deployed, to
                massively deployed. Here, we are thinking of lightweight
                semantics with a easy way for people to browse for vocabularies
                (to encourage re-use), to register their support, link to

                and a number of others. By collaborating on building a common
                understanding of these aims, we can build bridges across these
                different communities to facilitate work on gathering key use
                cases across a broad range of domains, identifying and analysing

        <p>Many projects and companies are looking at ways to use the Bitcoin

          an immutable time-stamped public record that can be independently
          verified by any stakeholder.</p>
        <p>It's unclear how these blockchains will need to interact with each
          other in the future to prove its benefits. But there’s consensus that
          some standards are needed to promote competition while eliminating
          redundancies. W3C held on 29–30 June 2016 <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/04/blockchain-workshop/">Blockchains

        <p>High-level take away from the workshop:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Most participants were interested in developing standard APIs and
            primitive data formats to allow both new and legacy applications to
            have consistent approaches to communicating with blockchains. </li>
          <li> Driven by business needs, the first objectives in this area
            included key management and payment protocols, and most are layers
            above blockchain that use cryptographic approaches. </li>
          <li> Hardware authentication was another area of significant interest.
          </li>
          <li> Transacting with a public/private key pair over a blockchain is
            more convenient and secure than today’s username/password identity
            schemes. </li>
          <li> Provenance: licensing of IP, assets, and services </li>
          <li> Impact on non-financial blockchain applications (on content
            creators, on digital assets, as coordinator of a user-centric
            environment for the Internet of Things). </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Next steps:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Organizing a follow-up workshop more focused on the browser
            vendors. </li>
          <li> Several W3C Community Groups created. </li>
          <li> The earliest Blockchain Community Group will continue to expand
            its scope and keep the conversation going </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="data">Web of Data</h2>
        <p>More and more Web applications provide a means of accessing data.
          From simple visualizations to sophisticated interactive tools, there
          is a growing reliance on the availability of data which can be “big”
          or “small”, of diverse origin, and in different formats; it is usually
          published without prior coordination with other publishers — let alone
          with precise modeling or common vocabularies. This diversity is
          overcome by providing standard data exchange formats, models, tools,
          and guidance, which facilitates Web-scale data integration and
          processing.</p>
        <p>Data and its usage should be discoverable and understandable by
          humans and machines. To facilitate interaction between publishers and
          consumers of Data, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2013/dwbp/">Data
            on the Web Best Practices Working Group</a> published a Candidate
          Recommendation of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/CR-dwbp-20160830/">Data
            on the Web Best Practices</a>.&nbsp; The DWBP WG is actively
          soliciting implementations from the community. <br>
        </p>
        <p>The closely related Share-PSI project, co-funded by the European
          Commission, has concluded its work recently with the publication of a
          set of high level policy-related <a href="https://www.w3.org/2013/share-psi/bp/">Best
            Practices</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/2013/share-psi/lg/">guides</a>
          for the sharing of public sector information online. Although targeted
          at Europe, the advice, which is available in many languages and
          contexts, is likely to be applicable world wide.</p>
        <p>W3C launched in February the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/poe/">Permissions

            Descriptions &amp; Smarter Vocabularies (SDSVoc) Workshop</a>, 30
          November – 1 December 2016, in Amsterdam, hosted by CWI and organized
          in conjunction with the EU funded project <a href="http://www.vre4eic.eu">
            VRE4EIC</a>.</p>
        <p>This workshop aims to clarify the steps needed to improve
          communication between data repositories and applications that use that
          data, such as virtual research environments. Applications may simply
          discover data or visualize it, manipulate it, discuss it, correct it,
          describe it, republish it, etc. The outcome may be a new W3C Working
          Group chartered to extend <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/">DCAT</a>
          and determine how human and machine-readable metadata profiles are
          defined and made discoverable. A further aim is to explore how W3C can
          best support vocabulary development for a variety of communities.</p>
        <h2 id="web-for-all">Web for All</h2>
        <h3 id="i18n">Internationalization (i18n)</h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/#tr_Internationalization__All_">All
            Standards and Drafts: Internationalization</a></p>
        <p>Fewer than one third of current Web users speak English as their
          native language and that proportion will continue to decrease as the
          Web reaches more and more communities of limited English proficiency.
          If the Web is to live up to the "World Wide" portion of its name, it
          must support the needs of world-wide users at a basic level as they
          engage with content in the various languages.</p>
        <p>The W3C Internationalization activities pursue this goal in various
          ways, including reviews, discussion and advice for Working Groups at
          the W3C, coordination with other organizations, creation of
          educational materials, gathering user requirements, and technical work
          itself on various topics. In this period the Internationalization
          Working Group, Internationalization Interest Group and
          Internationalization Tag Set Interest Group had their charter renewed.</p>
        <h4>Ongoing work for WG support</h4>
        <ul>
          <li> As usual, the i18n WG reviewed and discussed comments related to
            specifications of a number of Working Groups. In particular, during
            this period, the i18n Working Group has been working with WGs such
            as <strong>HTML, Web Annotations, Data on the Web Best Practices,
              and Digital Publishing</strong>. A list of ongoing discussions is
            available in our <a href="http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/reviews/">issue
              tracker</a>, and our <a href="http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/reviews/">review
              radar</a> lists upcoming reviews. </li>
          <li> Work is also ongoing in support of the <strong>Encoding
              specification</strong>. We have been tracking developments in the
            editor's version and producing up to date results for a large number
            of tests that were developed during the Candidate Recommendation
            stage. </li>
          <li> Progress has also been made in <strong>documenting best
              practices for Working Groups</strong>, so that they can
            proactively build good practice into their specifications from an
            early stage. Work continues on [Internationalization Best Practices
            for Spec Developers] (and its derived checklist <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/techniques/developing-specs?collapse">Internationalization
              Techniques: Developing specifications</a>), and on <a href="http://w3c.github.io/charmod-norm/">Character
              Model for the World Wide Web: String Matching and Searching</a>. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Ongoing work in education &amp; outreach</h4>
        <ul>
          <li> The start of 2016 saw a major effort to <strong>update our
              educational materials</strong>, including the task-based help at <a
              href="https://www.w3.org/International/techniques/authoring-html?collapse">Internationalization
              techniques: Authoring HTML &amp; CSS</a> and around 70 articles
            and tutorials listed there and in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/articlelist">index
              of articles</a>. </li>
          <li> Changes were made to <strong>improve readability and to reflect
              recent developments in technology</strong>, particularly in HTML
            and CSS. Many articles were substantially rewritten, including <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-ruby">What
              is ruby?</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-bidi-space">Bidi
              space loss</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-who-uses-unicode">Who
              uses Unicode?</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-lang-priorities">Setting

              to use Unicode controls for bidi text</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-bidi-controls">Unicode
              controls vs. markup for bidi support</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-bidi-css-markup">CSS
              vs. markup for bidi support</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-what-is-encoding">Character
              encodings for beginners</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-changing-encoding">Changing
              an HTML page to Unicode</a>, and a number were removed. </li>
          <li> We have also developed <strong>new articles</strong> on <a href="http://w3c.github.io/i18n-drafts/articles/ruby/markup.en.html">how
              to use ruby markup</a>, <a href="http://w3c.github.io/i18n-drafts/articles/vertical-text.en.html">how
              to use vertical text in CSS</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-site-conneg">guiding
              users to translated pages</a>, and <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-site-conneg">essential
              terms for working with time zones</a>. </li>
          <li> Additionally, work is under way to rewrite the Working Group
            Note, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/unicode-xml/">Unicode
              in XML</a>. </li>
          <li> In other areas, content was provided about things such as <strong>character
              encodings and language attributes for the new EdX course</strong>
            for HTML beginners, and support for internationalization topics was
            provided in the fora for that and the intermediate course. </li>
          <li> Also the Internationalization Working Group was represented at
            the <strong><a href="http://www.unicode-oman.org/">Unicode workshop
                in Oman</a> in February</strong>, with the anchor tutorial on
            the first day and a further tutorial about <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/talks/1602-oman/">Bidi
              support on the Web</a>. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Ongoing work in requirements development</h4>
        <p>Groups associated with the Internationalization Activity are also
          involved in <strong>documenting requirements for support of non-Latin
            scripts</strong>. These include Arabic, Ethiopic, Indic, Chinese and
          Mongolian. See a <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/layout">list
            of current activity</a>.</p>
        <h4>Ongoing work for Multilingual Web</h4>
        <ul>
          <li> The liaison with the OASIS committee <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/xliff-omos/">XLIFF
              OMOS</a> continued. The TC presented a <strong>first version of
              the object model</strong> in June 2016 at the Localization World
            conference FEISGILTT workshop. We will bring this object model to
            relevant W3C groups to assure its compatibility with Web
            technologies, were adequate. </li>
          <li> We continued again in liaison with OASIS the work on have the <a
              href="http://www.w3.org/TR/its20/">Internationalization
              Tag Set (ITS) 2.0 specification</a> available natively in XLIFF.
            This work will be documented in XLIFF 2.1, so that <strong>XLIFF
              tools conformant to the related XLIFF 2.1 module will understand
              ITS natively</strong>. The timeline for this work was planned to
            be Q1-Q2 2016 but is likely to be delayed until Q4 2017. </li>
          <li> The discussions at conferences about the usage of ITS 2.0 &amp;
            linked data in XLIFF and other XML formats led to the creation of a
            new community group <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/rax/">RAX</a>
            - RDF and XML Interoperability. A topic which seems to be of
            relevance beyond the I18N community. </li>
          <li> Work on linguistic linked data continued in various community
            groups. The OntoLex community group has published the report <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/05/ontolex/">OntoLex
              Lexicon Model for Ontologies</a>. The OntoLex model provides a
            machine readable way to represent language specific lexica on the
            Web and link them general knowledge sources. </li>
          <li> Outreach fostering the adoption of ITS 2.0 and the linguistic
            linked data technologies continued with the support of the EU <a href="http://www.freme-project.eu">FREME</a>
            project, including the development of <a href="http://api.freme-project.eu/doc/current/">open
              source implementations</a>. </li>
          <li> ITS 2.0 and its joined application with other technologies, esp.
            Web annotation and the OntoLex model, were presented at various
            academic and industry conferences: <a href="http://archive.xmlprague.cz/2016/files/xmlprague-2016-proceedings.pdf#page=133">XML

              <li> The Internationalization Working Group is <strong>looking
                  for additional participants</strong>, especially but not
                limited to those who can <strong>help with reviewing W3C and
                  Unicode specifications</strong>. </li>
              <li> The various layout requirements task forces are also looking
                for additional participation from <strong>experts in typography
                  for non-Latin scripts</strong>. </li>
              <li> Extensive lobbying is being undertaken in the EU to assure
                further, long-term funding opportunities for I18N related work.
                The main target is the <a href="http://bdva.eu/">Big Data Value
                  Association</a> which encompasses the topics of language and
                data related standardization. A dedicated <a href="http://bdva.eu/?q=task-force-6">task

              Guidelines (WCAG) Working Group</a> has re-evaluated how to
            integrate new guidance, and is exploring how to fold it into a <strong>WCAG&nbsp;2.1</strong>.
          </li>
          <li> This includes guidance in the areas of <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/mobile-a11y-tf/">mobile

          <li>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA">Accessible Platform
              Architectures Working Group</a> (APA WG) took up the Protocols and
            Formats Working Group's (PFWG) previous work doing <strong>"horizontal
              reviews" of W3C specifications under development</strong>. APA WG
            accessibility reviews help other W3C working groups identify and
            address potential accessibility barriers, and potential
            opportunities for accessibility innovations. APA typically reviews
            and provides <strong>comments on 25 or more draft specifications
              per year</strong>, thus helping support W3C's <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/mission.html#principles">Web
              for All</a> mission. </li>

          <li> The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/">Accessible Rich
              Internet Applications (ARIA) WG</a> took over the specification
            development responsibilities of the previous PFWG. Since the March
            2016 W3C AC meeting, the ARIA WG has been developing a pre-Candidate
            Recommendation version of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-wai-aria-1.1-20160317/">Accessible
              Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) 1.1</a>, which among other
            things replaces the aria-describedAt property with an aria-details
            property. The ARIA WG may defer some ARIA&nbsp;1.1 issues to ARIA
            2.0, which they will soon start collecting requirements for. </li>

              videos</a>. <strong>These brief videos provide a conceptual
              introduction to Web accessibility</strong> and are one of the
            resources that EOWG has developed to address requests for "easier
            on-ramps" for accessibility. </li>
          <li> The <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/">Education and Outreach
              Working Group</a> (EOWG) has published an <strong>easier-to-use

        <h2 id="org">Organizational evolution: internal functional reorganization</h2>
	<p>In order to better support the W3C Membership in creating new
	  Recommendations, the W3C Team will operate, starting September 26, 2016,
	  under an organization model that better accords with the
          nature of today's Web and the expectations of its diverse users,
          developers, and implementers. The new functional structure affects
          neither the role of the Director, nor how W3C creates new
          Recommendations, nor the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/">W3C
            Process</a>. The role of Team Contacts won't change, and one purpose
          of the re-org is to help them do their jobs better. We expect
          transition time to be as smooth and transparent as possible.</p>
        <p>Indeed, to <em>lead the Web to its full potential</em> today
          requires a flexible team organized to interact with a complex
          ecosystem of technologies, stakeholders, and industries. It requires
          well-researched strategy development, rigorous project management, and
          careful architectural coordination. The reorganization sustains and
          improves the existing unique strengths of W3C as a standards
          organization but places more focus on agile strategy development,
          excellence in execution, and coherence of the Web architecture.</p>
        <p>Some of the improvements this new structure will achieve and the new
          leadership roles assigned are described in-depth in <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/08/2016-reorg.html">2016
            W3C Internal Reorganization</a>.</p>
	<h3 id="strategy">Strategy Management</h3>
	<p>Lead: Wendy Seltzer.</p>
	<p>To be on top of the complex and fast-evolving Web, Strategy Management
          has primary responsibility to ensure that we are working on the correct
          topics, get started in new areas, and prioritize resources to where they
          are needed.</p>
	
	<h3 id="project">Project Management</h3>
	<p>Lead: Philippe Le Hégaret.</p>
	<p>To move again at Web-speed and to meet the platform where it will be,
          Project Management has primary responsibility to ensure that we deliver
          the specifications that are needed in a timely fashion, supporting and
          driving groups, chairs and editors to success.</p>
	
	<h3 id="architech">Architecture &amp; Technology Management</h3>
	<p>Lead: Ralph Swick (also continuing as COO).</p>
        <p>To directly support the Director, advise on and drive cohesive technical
          design, coordinate horizontal review, Architecture &amp; Technology
          Management ensures that the collection of specifications works well
          together to provide an overall architecture for the web.
          Success in identifying and completing topics increasingly depends on
          strengthening our relationships with our Members. These relationships
          enable us to understand Member needs and gain their full participation.</p>
	
        <h3 id="#industry">Industry Management</h3>
	<p>Lead: Philipp Hoschka.</p>
        <p>To reinforce visions, identify new requirements for groups and new
          products with Strategy Management, Industry Management focuses on
          Industry needs, engages and liaises with the standards organizations of
          those industries.</p>
	
	<h3 id="global">Global Participation Management</h3>
	<p>Lead: Angel Li (also continuing as Beihang Site Manager).</p>
        <p>Global Participation Management focuses on the essential task of
          increasing excellent Member activity in our groups and overcoming
          language, culture and time zone issues.</p>
	
	<h3 id="satisfaction">Member Satisfaction Management</h3>
        <p>Lead: Veronica Thom (also continuing as CFO).</p>
        <p>Member Satisfaction Management ensures that Members are satisfied with
          W3C and have channels to recommend improvement.</p>
	
	<h3 id="community">Community Management</h3>
	<p>Lead: Dominique Hazaël-Massieux (also continuing as Web and Mobile Devices Lead).</p>
        <p>Community Management ensures that we are working with key developers
          both inside and outside of our Membership.</p>
	
	<h3 id="specialists">Specialists and other support</h3>
	<p>Various Leads will be assisted by specialists who, in the case of strategy and 
	  Architecture &amp; Technology, restore some of the technical area focus previously 
	  provided by the Domains.</p>
	
	<p>Business Development is reshaped slightly to maximize and bring in new revenue.</p>
	
	<p>The Web Accessibility Initiative is a long-time publicly visible brand of W3C, 
	  and will be kept as a brand and as an Initiative, led by the WAI Director. 
	  As reflected in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/sponsor/webforall#wai">
	    WAI Sponsorship description</a>, the Initiative ensures a cohesive package 
	  of accessibility work to enable partnering of multiple stakeholder groups within 
	  the W3C structure, to address coordinated aspects of technical, educational, 
	  and standards harmonization work. However, whereas in the past the work was 
	  mostly managed by a single Domain, accessibility work is now distributed 
	  across the new functions (primarily Strategy, Project and Architecture &amp; 
	  Technology) supported by the WAI specialists and WAI Director, in order to 
	  leverage broader commitment to accessibility throughout the organization.</p>
	
	<p>Unchanged from today are Administration and Operations, 
	  Marketing &amp; Communications, Systems, Legal.</p>
	
        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
	<p>This is a time of change for the Web. W3C is responding with great changes. The Web 
	  community is growing, innovative, agile</p>
	<p>Growing Community: As the Publishing community is growing, 
	  'Web = Publishing' is becoming truer and truer, including joint efforts with IDPF 
	  to foster the (r)evolution of ebooks and a richer reading and learning experience.
	  The digital economy is growing as well. We continue to give particular attention to
	  the Web of Things and creating the platform that drives more connectivity needs, and
	  enabling the <abbr title="Internet of Things">IoT</abbr> interoperability. Platform 
	  cohesion being crucial, Web Security, Internationalization, Web Accessibility remain
	  key components as we expand towards the robust Open Web Platform our civilization is 
	  eager for.</p>
	<p>Innovative Community: As W3C continues to move forward with Web Payments, Web 
	  Real-Time Communications, automotive, Web Security, etc., it explores for standardization 
	  opportunities innovative areas like Blockchains and Virtual Reality. </p>
	<p>Agile Community: The W3C Team, under the impulsion of the 
	  <a href="https://www.w3.org/2002/ab/">W3C Advisory Board</a>, continues to regularly 
	  update and improve its Process Document. Process 2016 will soon be balloted for adoption 
	  while the public Revising the W3C Process Community Group is already considering changes
	  for Process 2017. Every once in a great while, the W3C Team undergoes an internal 
	  reorganization. In order to better support the W3C Membership in creating new 
	  Recommendations and keep up with the nature of today's Web, now is the time to 
	  become a fully flexible team organized to interact 
	  with technologies, stakeholders, and industries, to harness strategy development, 
	  rigorous project management, and careful architectural coordination.</p>
